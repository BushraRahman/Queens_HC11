    <b>Clean Hear Summary: </b>
   <li>
     The NYC Clean Heat program is focused 
      on shifting NYC's energy source to renewable energy. 
       Their goal is to achieve 70% renewably sourced electricity by 
      2030 and a zero-emission electric grid by 2040 (NYSERDA). 
      Two of the popular fuel that encourages people to use are #4 and #6 fuel. 
      #4 Fuel is distillate fuel oil made by blending distillate fuel oil and residual fuel oil stocks. 
       #6 Fuel is a heavy oil used by ocean liners and tankers as fuel and for oil-burning power plants. 
       Before changing, installing, or removing a boiler, the owner needs to report the information to the Department of Environmental Protection Boiler Registration (DEP). 
       It is usually monitored through the Clean Air Tracking system at the DEP. 
       Along with that, The Greener Greater Buildings plan is a six-point plan to make the 22,000 buildings that are over 50,000 square feet in New York City energy efficient. 
       This is because these buildings are responsible for 45% of the energy usage in NYC.
       The points in the plan are to create a law that addresses a loophole in New Yorkâ€™s state code so 
       that inefficient equipment must be replaced by efficient equipment, require large buildings to upgrade their lighting, 
       to require that large buildings do an annual analysis of their energy consumption, to require large buildings to conduct a decennial energy audit
        and to do retro-commissioning, to train workers for the new green jobs created by this plan, and 
        to finance fund owners who cannot afford to make these upgrades. 
        Building is converted to clean heating fuels by using other fuels such as natural gas, renewable energy, and biofuels which decreases the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere.

   <b>NYC Emission Reports: </b>
   <li>
    NYC buildings, particularly those in Queens, contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions due to fossil fuel reliance and energy inefficiency. 
    Many buildings use natural gas for heating, which, while less polluting than oil or coal, still releases methane and other harmful byproducts.
     Additionally, energy-inefficient appliances and windows lead to higher energy consumption and increased emissions. 
     To combat this, NYC has implemented various regulations, including bans on fossil fuel heating in new buildings, mandates for energy-efficient appliances, and requirements for emission control devices on cooking stoves.
     These measures aim to reduce the city's carbon footprint and improve air quality.

   <b>Flushing Data Analysis: </b>
   <li>
    The graphs present the amount of energy consumption from multiple buildings in Flushing, Queens. 
    The neighborhood features a diverse range of building sizes and ages, with a significant number of buildings utilizing #4 fuel for heating. 
    While #6 fuel usage is less prevalent, it still contributes to the overall energy consumption. 
    According to the data, Flushing has a subset of buildings with exceptionally high fuel consumption, suggesting the presence of large-scale facilities or energy-intensive operations. 
    These outliers underscore the potential for energy efficiency improvements and the need to target specific buildings for optimization.
