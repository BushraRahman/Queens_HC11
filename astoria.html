    <p> The NYC Clean Heat program is focused on shifting NYC’s energy source to renewable energy. 
      Their goal is to achieve “70% renewably sourced electricity by 2030 and a zero-emission electric grid by 2040” (NYSERDA). 
      Two of the popular fuel that encourages people to use are #4 and #6 fuel. #4 Fuel is distillate fuel oil made by blending distillate fuel oil and residual fuel oil stocks. 
      #6 Fuel is a heavy oil used by ocean liners and tankers as fuel and for oil-burning power plants. Before changing, installing, or removing a boiler, the owner needs to report the information to the Department of Environmental Protection Boiler Registration (DEP).
      It is usually monitored through the Clean Air Tracking system at the DEP. Along with that, The Greener Greater Buildings plan is a six-point plan to make the 22,000 buildings that are over 50,000 square feet in New York City energy efficient. 
      This is because these buildings are responsible for 45% of the energy usage in NYC. The points in the plan are to create a law that addresses a loophole in New York’s state code so that inefficient equipment must be replaced by efficient equipment, to require large buildings to upgrade their lighting, to require that large buildings do an annual analysis of their energy consumption, to require large buildings to conduct a decennial energy audit and to do retro-commissioning, to train workers for the new green jobs created by this plan, and to finance fund owners who cannot afford to make these upgrades. <p>
      Building is converted to clean heating fuels by using other fuels such as natural gas, renewable energy, and biofuels which decreases the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere.
     <p> Fossil fuels for heating in NYC:
        The majority of homes in New York City use natural gas heating (“New York City Bans Heating Oil & Natural Gas”). 
       Gas heating is harmful since, although natural gas emits less carbon dioxide compared to oil or coal, it releases the greenhouse gas methane (“Here Come Heat Pumps: NYC Banning Gas Hookups in New Buildings”). 
       Along with contributing to climate change, gas heating is also less energy-efficient compared to electric heating and it releases toxic byproducts into the air.
       An alternative to natural gas heating is electric heat pumps, which are also effective for cooling (Brian Bonar). 
       There are several laws that address the issue of gas heating. Introduction No. 2317-A will not allow heating with fossil fuels that emit more than 25 kg of CO2 per million BTU, which means that natural gas and fuel oil has been banned. 
       This law applies to buildings under seven stories after 2023 and for building with at least seven stories after July 1, 2027 (Tobias). 
       This will be effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
       For example, a building in NYC is undergoing a project to replace its fossil fuel-reliant heating with electric heat pumps, and this is predicted to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 70% relative to its levels in 2019 (Takemura).
       Additionally, in order to replace combusting heating within the state, New York approved a plan that requires every home built after 2024 to install non-combustion heating systems, and if an existing fossil fuel-burning heating unit breaks after 2030, it will be replaced with non-combustion heating (Brian Bonar). <p>
