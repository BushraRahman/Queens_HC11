    The NYC Clean Heat program wants to make NYC use renewable energy. Its goal is to have 70% of electricity be renewably sourced by 2030 and for the electric grid to have zero emissions by 2040 in NYC. The oil used in boilers is #4 and #6 fuel. DEP Boiler Registration tracks boilers. The Greener Greater Buildings plan is a plan with six points that has the goal of making buildings with over 50k square feet energy efficient. Finally, buildings can covert to clean heating fuels by using fuels such as natural gas, renewable energy, and biofuels.
