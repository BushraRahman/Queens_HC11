  <h2>HC3 Summary</h2>
  <p>
    The NYC Clean Heat program wants to make NYC use renewable energy. Its goal is to have 70% of electricity be renewably sourced by 2030 and for the electric grid to have zero emissions by 2040 in NYC. The oil used in boilers is #4 and #6 fuel. DEP Boiler Registration tracks boilers. The Greener Greater Buildings plan is a plan with six points that has the goal of making buildings with over 50k square feet energy efficient. Finally, buildings can covert to clean heating fuels by using fuels such as natural gas, renewable energy, and biofuels.

  <h2>HC4 Summary</h2>
  <p>
    Over half of homes in NYC use natural gas heating. which is harmful since it releases the greenhouse gas methane. Along with contributing to global warming, gas heating also released toxic byproducts and uses more energy compared to electric heating. An alternative to natural gas heating is electric pumps. There are many laws to limit gas heating, including Introduction No. 2317-A.
