    <p> The NYC Clean Heat program is focused on shifting NYC’s energy source to renewable energy. Their goal is to achieve “70% renewably sourced electricity by 2030 and a zero-emission electric grid by 2040” (NYSERDA). Two of the popular fuel that encourages people to use are #4 and #6 fuel. Fuel #4 is found to be a more green energy source which is why it is more widely used throughout the boroughs. An important factor is windows. There is the Greener Greater Building plan that is working on making 22,000 buildings energy efficent. This is a major move as those building use 45% of the total energy in NYC.</p>
    <p> The majority of homes in New York City use natural gas heating. It is not the best option but it releases less carbon emissions than oil or coal. A greener option would be electric heating. There has been much legislation passed to limit emmisions. For example Local Law 97 and Intro 2317. Building create 80% of the green house gas emission, therefore it is stressed that residents use engery efficient appliances as well as electric energy. They contribute greatly to energy loss which is why properly sealing building is important in using energy efficiently.</p>
    <p> We found that when comparing fuels #4 and #6 that #4 seems to be used much more than #6. We found, within NYC as a whole, that much of the boilers are past their retirement age. This can prove dangerous as boilers are meant to only last some 15 years and usage past that expiration can result in dangerous levels of carbon monoxide, corrosion, etc. </p>
