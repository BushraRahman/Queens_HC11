    <p> The NYC Clean Heat program is focused on shifting NYC’s energy source to renewable energy. Their goal is to achieve “70% renewably sourced electricity by 2030 and a zero-emission electric grid by 2040” (NYSERDA). Two of the popular fuel that encourages people to use are #4 and #6 fuel. Fuel #6 is found to be a more green energy source which is why it is more widely used throughout the boroughs.</p>
